      description:
        "we are presenting a proposed system for IoT Based drone for militaryapplication. In this drone the most expensive feature is that the drone can fly, swim, run, using Pixhaw and Raspberry pi 3 using MQTT protocol and it is done by integrating with the help of various sensors,cameras into web application using MQTT and HTTP protocol. To develop and design, we are using Pixhawk and Raspberry pi 3 embedded board with python programming & MQTT protocol. Using this system can monitor and control the drone from anywhere through XB station. XB station is a solution for streaming video and controling UAV via internet (wifi, 3G/4G/5G cellular network). It includes: open hardware on drone (PX4 and ArduPilot) and software on ground . And it has various sensors like motion sensor to sense the existence of human, pitch sensor to make the 3D mapping, Inductive proximity sensor to detect landmines (metal), temperature sensor to sense the temperature and various gas sensors to detect hazardous gaseous in the environment. And this drones has extra feature is that it can draw a 3D mapping of specified location. Whenever detect, the raspberry pi will start publishing the data using the MQTT protocol and display on Server and also all the sensor data will publish on server. In this drone we have mounted ultrasonic sensor and xyro (MPU6050) with the help of this Sensor we are measure the area of this room and where the object is found after finding the object PIR sensor give the data of existance of human and also from pitch sensor we have making a 3D image of room where terrorist is hidden and all data will send to the server.",
